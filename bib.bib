This result was obtained by the present authors earlier as a corollary of a general study of group-invariant percolation. The goal here is to present a simpler self-contained proof that easily extends to quasi-transitive graphs with a unimodular automorphism group. The key tool is a "mass-transport" method, which is a technique of averaging in nonamenable settings.},

The simple arguments extend to a broad class of finite-dimensional models, including bond percolation and regular lattices.},

  abstract = {Quite apart from the fact that percolation theory had its ongm in an honest applied problem, it is a source of fascinating problems of the best kind for which a mathematician can wish: problems which are easy to state with a minimum of preparation, but whose solutions are apparently difficult and require new methods. At the same time, many of the prob- lems are of interest to or proposed by statistical physicists and not dreamed up merely to demonstrate ingenuity. Much progress has been made in recent years, and many of the open problems of ten years aga have been solved. With such solutions we have seen the evolution of new techniques and questions; the consequent knowledge has shifted the ground under percolation, and it is time to examine afresh the mathematics of the subject. The quantity of literature related to percolation seems to grow hour by hour, mostly in the physics journals. It is becoming increasingly diffi- cult to get to know the subject from scratch, and one of the principal purposes of this book is to remedy this. This book is about the mathematics of percolation theory, with the emphasis upon presenting the shortest rigorous proofs of the main facts.},

In response to questions raised by Grimmett and Newman (1990) and Benjamini and Schramm (1996), we show that the property of having (almost surely) a unique infinite open cluster is increasing in p. Moreover, in the standard coupling of the percolation models for all parameters, a.s. for all p.sub.2{$>$}p.sub.1{$>$}p.sub.c, each infinite p.sub.2-cluster contains an infinite p.sub.1-cluster this yields an extension of Alexander's (1995) "simultaneous uniqueness" theorem. As a corollary, we obtain that the probability Î¸.sub.v(p) that a given vertex v belongs to an infinite cluster is depends continuously on p throughout the supercritical phase p{$>$}p.sub.c. All our results extend to quasi-transitive infinite graphs with a unimodular automorphism group.
